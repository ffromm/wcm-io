## wcm.io Testing

Helper tools for supporting Unit Tests, Integration test and test automation in AEM-based projects.


### Overview

* [AEM Mocks](aem-mock/): Mock implementations for running unit tests in AEM context without having to run a real AEM or Sling instance:
* [JUnit Commons](junit-commons/): Common extensions of JUnit for supporting the wcm.io JUnit tests.


### Mocking stack

Initially wcm.io provided mocking implementations for JCR, OSGi and Sling. These implementations are now part of the Apache Sling project and maintained by the Sling Community:

* [Sling Mocks](http://sling.apache.org/documentation/development/sling-mock.html)
* [OSGi Mocks](http://sling.apache.org/documentation/development/osgi-mock.html)
* [JCR Mocks](http://sling.apache.org/documentation/development/jcr-mock.html)
